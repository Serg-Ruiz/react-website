                <p className='first-paragraph'>
                    The first step in building my website was to gain a comprehensive understanding of React.
                    I had previously heard of React and knew it was a framework for creating websites. After
                    conducting thorough research, I realized that React was not as complex as I had initially thought,
                    largely due to my background in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from my college coursework.

                    Following additional online research, I decided to install Vite and began customizing the provided template to suit my requirements.
                    Interestingly, I have always found organization in HTML and CSS challenging. However, Vite seemed more intuitive to me, and the code felt more structured,
                    which facilitated a smoother and more efficient development process. This allowed me to concentrate on creating a functional and visually appealing website.

                    Initially, I was hesitant to delve into React because of its reputation online,
                    which led me to believe it would be significantly different from what I was accustomed to.
                    I was reluctant to invest time in learning something entirely new. However, upon discovering that React is a JavaScript library
                    , my apprehensions diminished, as I had previous experience working with C++ libraries. Once I started coding, I found that React
                    was not drastically different from the JavaScript I had learned in my coursework.
